			<p>Today, tight labor markets and new workforce needs—often resulting from technological disruption—are forcing employers to rethink job requirements. Hiring practices are slowly shifting toward selecting workers based on skills and work experience, rather than educational pedigree. This means that a four-year degree is no longer the only path to meaningful employment and economic stability. But, capitalizing on this opportunity is not always straightforward because it can be difficult to identify the high-quality, skill building programs that directly lead to good jobs.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text-partial">
			<p>With the path to meaningful employment in flux, high school graduates today face a dizzying array of options. In addition to traditional two and four-year colleges,  many other educational options—technical colleges, training programs, hybrid colleges, boot camps, and apprenticeships—are rapidly expanding. Despite this, only one in two adults in the US has a credential beyond a high school diploma. </p>
			<p>The need for thoughtful, personalized matchmaking between young talent and pathways to careers has never been greater. The stakes are high to select the right institution or program and develop the necessary skills to engage in today’s workforce. Every young person should have the opportunity, guidance, and tools to create an individualized path to their optimal career. An abundance of information, advice and data is available, but it is uncurated and difficult to organize. altPath is purpose built to solve this. </p>

			<p>For many students, an unexpected expense – a medical bill, car breakdown, or increase in child care costs – that stretches their budget can force them to drop out of college. With at least one-third of all students saying that they don’t have $500 on hand for emergencies, the altAid program aims to support students through these financial crises by providing direct financial assistance for unexpected expenses that create a burden and can threaten to derail their education.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="text-partial">
			<p>Students facing unforeseen financial crises can complete a simple online application for an altAid grant in less than 10 minutes. Decisions are communicated within 2 business days and funds are deployed directly to students. altAid’s quick turnaround and easy-to-use platform provides critical financial relief with minimal hassle, allowing students to remain focused on school.</p>

			<p>Eligibility—<br>
			altAid is available to LOC Scholars and students who have completed an altPath action list and are enrolled in higher education, a workforce development program, or other vocational training pathway. To qualify for financial support, students must have experienced an unexpected financial hardship within the last 60 days that is impacting their ability to pursue their education.</p>

			<p>LOC Scholars is an undergraduate scholarship program available to high achieving high school juniors with financial need who seek to attend and graduate from selective four-year colleges and universities. We depart from the standard formula for higher education opportunity programs by intervening ahead of the college application cycle to provide comprehensive higher education support and funding to high potential middle and working class students so they are positioned to reap the full benefit of their undergraduate experiences and, just as importantly, are not derailed by the types of expenses and contingencies that disproportionately affect them.</p>

			<h1>USC Price Report: An Evaluation of Emergency Aid Programs</h1>
		</div>
	</section>

	<section class="text type-body-carbone">
		<p>The Leonetti/O’Connell Family Foundation established emergency aid programs at USC and LACCD in 2019. Although the programs differ slightly in their application and disbursement processes, both programs provide cash assistance to students experiencing financial hardships that threaten to derail their academic success.</p>
		<p>To analyze the outcomes of the emergency aid pilots, the evaluation utilized administrative data, which included information such as the types of expenses for which students were requesting help. Additionally, the evaluation included interviews with program recipients to understand how receiving the aid impacted students’ lives.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="component-quote">
		<blockquote>“The USC program received 170 applications, of which it approved 81%. Awards averaged $852, for a total disbursement of almost $117,000. Meanwhile, the LACCD program granted 405 awards averaging $627 for a total disbursement of $254,000. Across both locations, applicants most often requested assistance for food, housing, and other basic needs. Both programs also received relatively high numbers of applications during March and April of 2020, the onset of the covid-19 outbreak.”</blockquote>
